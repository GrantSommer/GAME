##Your Objective
To kill all of the zombies, to survive the longest.

Join your friends or play solo, with anyone else that decides to join.

##Coins
You get coins by killing zombies

##Lootbox
Lootboxes spawn randomly on the map and are announced in chat.
Lootboxes can be destroyed by shooting 5 (bug: six) bullets at them.

Lootboxes can spawn bullets (random: 10-50), health (random: 5-15), coins (random: 30-50)

##Rounds
Each round starts after all of the zombies are dead.
Then you get a 10 second brake to visit the shop.

##The map
The map is a 7x7 grid, each square is a room.
- A light red square means a lootbox is in that room.
- A red square means you are in that room (room is also highlighted in red)
- A green number is how many zombies are there

##Zombies
Zombies can get next to you then eat you.
The health depends on the round, and so does the count.
When you kill one, you get 1 coin.

*Because the way I coded it* I couldn't make an ai to go to other rooms...
So it will teleport to the room next to them if a player is in it.

##Upgrades
* Max health
  - Adds +5 to your max health (20 -> 25)
  - Your health will regenerate to your new max
  - **Price** 100 Coins
